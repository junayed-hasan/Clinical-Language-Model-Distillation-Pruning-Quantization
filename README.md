# OptimCLM: Optimizing Clinical Language Models for Predicting Patient Outcomes


## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of OptimCLM, a framework designed to optimize Clinical Language Models (CLMs) for predicting patient outcomes through knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization. Our approach compresses CLMs without significant performance loss, thus facilitating their deployment in real-world clinical applications.

## Highlights
- Integration of clinical outcome prediction across the patient healthcare journey.
- Compression of clinical language models using knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization.
- Enhancement of healthcare systems by optimizing resources and improving patient outcomes.
- Superior performance on major clinical outcome prediction tasks compared to state-of-the-art models.
- Effective domain-knowledge transfer through ensemble learning with distillation.
